### Weekly distribution website

This project served as an educational endeavor, mimicking a possible scenario encountered in real-world contexts. Imagine a company aiming to encourage more in-office work from its employees. To facilitate this transition, I was tasked with developing a straightforward software solution. This software needed to handle input data consisting of employee names and their respective on-site availability throughout the week. The objective? To determine the most popular workdays, identify employees able to attend, and highlight those unable to do so.

The input data arrived in a specific format:

- Each line contained a person's name and a comma, followed by a comma-separated list of their availability for each day of the week.
- Availability was indicated with "true" or "false" values, encapsulated within square brackets.

Example:

John Doe, [true, false, false, true, true]
Jane Smith, []

Notably, an empty list of availability would imply "true" for all days.

### The challenge

While this code could function efficiently within a terminal environment, I chose to embrace a broader challenge. Instead of limiting myself to a terminal-based solution, I opted to explore the realms of both frontend and backend development. Although the task at hand could feasibly be achieved solely through frontend scripting, I viewed this project as an opportunity to delve into the creation of a full-stack website.

By venturing into both frontend and backend development, I aimed to deepen my understanding of how these components synergize to deliver a cohesive user experience.

### Built with

- **HTML:** Used for creating the structure of the frontend web pages.
- **CSS:** Utilized for styling the HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, etc.
- **JavaScript:** Employed for implementing the logic and interactivity of the frontend, including handling user inputs and making requests to the backend.
- **Node.js:** Used for building the backend server.
- **Express.js:** A Node.js web application framework used for simplifying backend development by providing a set of robust features for building web applications and APIs.

### What I learned

Through this project, I've gained valuable insights and honed various skills. Here's a summary of what I learned:

- **Full-Stack Development:** I delved into both frontend and backend development, learning how to create a cohesive web application that integrates frontend user interfaces with backend server logic.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** I strengthened my understanding of these foundational web technologies, using HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling elements, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- **Node.js and Express.js:** I explored server-side development using Node.js and the Express.js framework, learning how to create RESTful APIs, handle HTTP requests and responses, and implement server-side logic.
- **HTTP Requests and APIs:** I learned how to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend using the Fetch API, and how to define and consume APIs on the server side.
- **Data Handling:** I gained experience in parsing and processing data, including JSON data transmitted between the frontend and backend, and implementing algorithms to analyze and manipulate data as required by the project.
- **Error Handling and Debugging:** I encountered various challenges throughout the development process, which helped me improve my skills in debugging code and handling errors effectively.

Overall, this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience and helped me grow as a developer by expanding my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of web development concepts and practices.
